## Workflow 

I had a great time working on this project - I appreciate the altruistic tone to it! :) 

I generated the basic React structure with Create-React-App and added a couple dependencies I enjoy working with, namely the library AphroditeJs, a CSS-in-JS inline style tool that simplifies the overall folder hierachy (IMHO).

With my focus on building out the HTML structure before adding logic, I worked from the largest modularized containers down to smaller resuable compnents that may reappear (buttons, logos, etc). I styled during this step and worked to refine the responsiveness as I built up each section of CSS - I find this saves time and lessens stress than doing a single-view mockup and going back to introduce responsivity.

After the skeleton was complete, I implemented the logic in the React style, focusing on state management as I decided Redux was an overkill.
